              Drōv's initial product release is its <strong>Precise Tire Pressure Management System</strong>. Conventional automatic tire
              inflation has provided a tremendous boost to the commercial vehicle industry. Early adopters have
              experienced the benefits of improved fuel efficiency and mitigation of the dangerous and costly effects
              from
              under-inflated tires.

            <p>
              Drōv’s <strong>Precise Tire Pressure Management System</strong> takes the next step forward by providing fleet customers
              with
              the ability to <strong>PRECISELY</strong> maintain trailer tire pressure while driving to within a target range that they
              have determined safely and effectively meets their business objectives. Not too much. Not too little.
              <strong>Precisely the tire pressure desired.</strong>

            Performs</h3>

          <p>You determine the tire pressure that best supports your business and optimizes tread life and fuel economy.
            From there, our system does ther rest by maintaining your trailer’s tire pressure to within a target
            pressure range while connected to an air source.</p>
          <br/>
          <p>Should your vehicle experience an unexpected tire puncture or valve stem issue, the Drōv System will
            continue to provide air flow to the affected tire and alert the driver of a pressure drop.</p>

                Proprietary valves enable tire pressure to be maintained to within a target range throughout the trip.
                As environmental and road conditions change, tire temperatures modulate and so does tire pressure. The
                Drōv Precise System will adjust the tire system pressure to maintain the pressure you deem appropriate
                and mitigate the issues caused by under and over-inflation.

                <strong> Ease of installation and care</strong>
              </p>

              <p>
                You have choices. The Drōv Precise System can be installed by your preferred trailer manufacturer when
                placing new orders; a Drōv technician can perform the service on your site; or your own Team can install
                the system. The modular components and DOT approved push connections allow for simple, safe and secure
                installation.

                Every Drōv component is designed with an eye to the future. As new product releases are introduced, the
                core system elements will be leveraged so that customers who choose to upgrade can benefit from expanded
                functionality without the need to replace their entire systems.
